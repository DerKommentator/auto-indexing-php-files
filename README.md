# autoIndexing
Simply a Python script that automatically writes every new PHP file into the menue.html. 
The menue.html is just a list of all PHP files stored in the folder and subfolders. 
The menue.html is then displayed in a frameset.

Info: This is an old project and nothing is documented. Hopefully this will change in new projects.
